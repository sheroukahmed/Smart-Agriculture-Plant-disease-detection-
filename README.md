# Plant Disease Application 

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

Food shortage and population growth are the biggest challenges facing sustainable development worldwide. Advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and the mobile internet can provide realistic solutions to the challenges that are facing the world. Our project aims to improve agriculture and reduce the impact of diseases and attacks that harm the plants, reduce risks caused by them, and limit the food loss caused. According to International Journal of Engineering and Technology (IRJET) research, crop losses caused due to diseases, pests, animals, and weeds are about 20% to 40% of the global agricultural productivity. Therefore, this work focuses on solving agricultural problems with the aid of artificial intelligence (AI). We built five DL models, each of them classifies the plant from the image given according to the user’s choice in the application. First one, allows the user to know whether the plant is healthy or diseased from an image for the leaf, second one, if the plant is diseases it allows the classification of the type of disease from the same image, third one, classify the type of attack according to the input image, fourth one, helps the user to know the name of the plant structure provided in the image given for the DL model, the last one classify the plant according to its genus and species from the input image. Which of these models will be performing depends on the user’s choice after uploading or capturing the image of the plant. In brief, our results in the models were 98% in the healthy or diseased binary classification, 97% in type of disease classification, 88% in type of attack classification, 99.8% in structure recognition and 94.09% in plant species classification.
